//!          to indicate that the character was not output, and 1 to indicated
//!          that it was output.

//!
//!  The format string `fmt` consists of ordinary characters, escape
//!  sequences, and format specifications. The ordinary characters and escape
//!  sequences are output in their order of appearance. Format specifications
//!  start with a percent sign (%) and are read from left to right. When
//!  the first format specification (if any) is encountered, it converts the
//!  value of the first argument after `fmt` and outputs it accordingly.
//!  The second format specification causes the second argument to be
//!  converted and output, and so on. If there are more arguments than there
//!  are format specifications, the extra arguments are ignored. The
//!  results are undefined if there are not enough arguments for all the
//!  format specifications.
//!
//!  A format specification has optional, and required fields, in the following
//!  form:
//!
//!     %[flags][width][.precision][l]type
//!
//!  Each field of the format specification is a single character or a number
//!  specifying a particular format option. The simplest format specification
//!  contains only the percent sign and a @b type character (for example %s).
//!  If a percent sign is followed by a character that has no meaning as a
//!  format field, the character is sent to the output function. For example,
//!  to print a percent-sign character, use %%.
//!
//!  The optional fields, which appear before the type character, control
//!  other aspects of the formatting, as follows:
//!
//!  @b flags may be one of the following:
//!
//!  - - (minus sign) left align the result within the given field width.
//!  - 0 (zero) Zeros are added until the minimum width is reached.
//!
//!  @b width may be one of the following:
//!  - a number specifying the minimum width of the field
//!  - * (asterick) means that an integer taken from the argument list will
//!    be used to provide the width. The @a width argument must precede the
//!    value being formatted in the argument list.
//!
//!  @b precision may be one of the following:
//!  - a number
//!  - * (asterick) means that an integer taken from the argument list will
//!    be used to provide the precision. The @a precision argument must
//!    precede the value being formatted in the argument list.
//!
//!  The interpretation of @a precision depends on the type of field being
//!  formatted:
//!  - For b, d, o, u, x, X, the precision specifies the minimum number of
//!    digits that will be printed. If the number of digits in the argument
//!    is less than @a precision, the output value is padded on the left with
//!    zeros. The value is not truncated when the number of digits exceeds
//!    @a prcision.
//!  - For s, the precision specifies the maximum number of characters to be
//!    printed.
//!
//!  The optional type modifier l (lowercase ell), may be used to specify
//!  that the argument is a long argument. This makes a difference on
//!  architectures where the sizeof an int is different from the sizeof a long.
//!
//!  @b type causes the output to be formatted as follows:
//!  - b Unsigned binary integer.
//!  - c Character.
//!  - d Signed decimal integer.
//!  - o Unsigned octal integer.
//!  - s Null terminated character string.
//!  - u Unsigned Decimal integer.
//!  - x Unsigned hexadecimal integer, using "abcdef".
//!  - X Unsigned hexadecimal integer, using "ABCDEF".
//!
//! @return  The number of characters actually contained in `outStr`, not
//!          including the temrinating null character. This differs slightly
//!          from snprintf which returns the number of characters that would
//!          have been written if the output buffer were unlimited in size.

//!          which are defined as aliases in the .cpp file, allow using the %b format
